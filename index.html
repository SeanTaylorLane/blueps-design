    <h1>Click to progress through app</h1>
    <p>This was made for HackRU Spring 2017, 3rd place. It is an API that uses machine learning to determine a user's exact location based off the signal strength the device has between bluetooth nodes. It's more accurate than GPS and does not require data or device-native computing. Corporations and developers could utilize the API to build interactive physical environments (ex. like walking up to a car in a dealership to get information, pictures, links, etc.). My partner, <a href="http://github.com/aep000/">Alex Parson</a>, developed the back-end and I built a museum app to demo its functionality.</p>
    <p>When you click, the app takes you through the different museum exhibits instead of you walking up to them. Cause you can't.</p>
